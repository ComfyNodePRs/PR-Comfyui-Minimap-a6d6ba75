# Comfyui Minimap

This is the initial build of a comfyui minimap.

Very simple so far. It makes a copy of the workflow graph, simplified and minified, in the bottom left hand corner. It puts a red border where your viewport is. Left click on the minimap and it will move your viewport to that location.

## To-do
- I want to be able to use the scroll when cursor is over the minimap, so I can aim and zoom.
- show groups on hover
- add better placement options
